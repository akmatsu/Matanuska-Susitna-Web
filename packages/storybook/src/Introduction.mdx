# Matanuska-Susitna Borough UI Library

This is the core UI Library used by the Matanuska-Susitna Borough's websites.

## Getting Started

### Installation

> This package uses TailwindCSS and in order for the styles to work you must also have tailwind installed and configured in your application. The shared tailwindcss configs are in the `@matsugov/configs` package which is why that also needs to be installed.

Install this package in another package/site in this monorepo:

```bash
pnpm i -F <package-name> @matsugov/ui @matsugov/configs --workspace
```

Be sure to also install TailwindCSS

```bash
pnpm i -F <package-name> -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
```

### Setup

Once you've installed everything create a `tailwind.config.js` and a `postcss.config.js` file within your project folder. Within those files use the respective shared configs from `@matsugov/configs`.

```js
// tailwind.config.js

/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  presets: [require('@matsugov/configs/tailwind.config')],
};
```

## Usage

In general you use this library by importing and using components within your project. Here's an example using the MButton component:

```tsx
import { MButton } from '@matsugov/ui';

export default function home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <MButton>Click me!</MButton>;
    </div>
  );
}
```
